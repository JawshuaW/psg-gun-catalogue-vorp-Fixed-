# psg-gun-catalogue-vorp

An interactive catalogue for purchasing weapons similar to the one found in RDO.

## FEATURES

- An interactive weapons catalogue UI similar to the one in RDO

- Buy weapons and ammo from the UI

- Configurable global weapon and ammo prices

- Uses `BASE_WEAPON_NAMES` and `baseammonames` for ease of use

- More to come!

## INSTALLATION

- Download the zip

- Place in an appropriate folder in `resources` (ie `[ ThirdParty ]`)

- add `ensure psg-gun-catalogue-vorp` to your `server.cfg` below both dependencies (don't rename the folder as this will break the mod)

- Disable any other gun stores that you have (such as the ones found in vorp_weaponsv2, just delete the contents of the store config)

- Set your weapon prices in `server.lua`

- You should be good to go!

- OPTIONAL: Leave any comments, questions, suggestion or bugs in the issue section. Thanks!

## DEPENDENCIES
