🔫 Looking to add a clean and immersive gun browsing experience to your RedM server?

This is a **fixed and polished version** of the PSG Gun Catalogue script for VORP Core. It allows players to view every weapon in the game, complete with a smooth UI and proper names.

I did **not** create the original script — I’ve simply **fixed bugs, cleaned up the UI**, and made it easier to install and use for modern VORP setups.

✨ **Features:**
- 🧾 Catalogue-style UI to browse all available guns
- 🛠️ Fixed issues from the original release (UI behavior, compatibility)
- 🔫 View weapon stats, categories, and names
- 🎨 Clean and historically styled layout
- 💻 Fully NUI-based (HTML/CSS/JS) interface
- ✅ Compatible with modern VORP setups

🛠️ **Installation:**
1. Drop the folder into your server resources
2. Add `ensure psg-gun-catalogue-vorp-Fixed-` to your `server.cfg`
3. You're done! No SQL import required
